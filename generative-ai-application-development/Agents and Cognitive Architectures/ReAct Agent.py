# MAGIC # LAB - Create a ReAct Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, we will create a virtual stock advisor agent that uses the **ReAct** prompting framework. This agent will reason and act based on the prompts and tools provided.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Of course, the agent is built for demonstration purposes and the answers shouldn't be used as investment advice!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Lab Outline:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you will need to complete the following tasks;
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 1 :** Define the agent brain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 2 :** Define the agent tools
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 3 :** Define an agent logic
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 4 :** Create the agent 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Task 5 :** Run the agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **📝 Your task:** Complete the **`<FILL_IN>`** sections in the code blocks and follow the other steps as instructed.

# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - Click **More** in the drop-down.
# MAGIC    
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** window, use the first drop-down to select your unique cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.

mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"Username:          {DA.username}")
print(f"Catalog Name:      {DA.catalog_name}")
print(f"Schema Name:       {DA.schema_name}")
print(f"Working Directory: {DA.paths.working_dir}")
print(f"Dataset Location:  {DA.paths.datasets}")

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 1: Define the Brain of the Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by defining the agent brain using one of the available LLMs on Databricks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * For this lab, use **databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct** 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Define the maximum number of tokens

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_databricks import ChatDatabricks

# define the brain
llm_llama = ChatDatabricks(endpoint="databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct", max_tokens = 2500)

# COMMAND ----------

# let's test the brain
llm_llama.invoke("Hi! How are you?")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 2 : Define Tools that the Agent Will Use
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For an agent, the toolset is a crucial component to complete the defined task. The agent will reason about the next action to take and use an appropriate tool to complete that action.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For our stock advisor agent, we will use the following tools:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Wikipedia tool**: For searching company details. [[LangChain Doc](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/wikipedia/)]
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **DuckDuckGo Search tool**: This will be used for searching the latest news and updates about a stock.[[LangChain Doc](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg/)]
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **YouTube search tool**: This will be used to search for review videos about the latest financial reports. [[LangChain Doc](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/youtube/)]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Wikipedia Tool

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.utilities import WikipediaAPIWrapper

api_wrapper = WikipediaAPIWrapper(top_k_results=3, doc_content_chars_max=1000)
tool_wiki = WikipediaQueryRun(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)

# COMMAND ----------

# Test the Wikipedia tool
tool_wiki.run("Apple company history")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### DuckDuckGo Search Tool

# COMMAND ----------

# DuckDuckGo Search Tool
from langchain_community.tools.ddg_search import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

tool_news = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

# COMMAND ----------

# Test DuckDuckGo tool
tool_news.run("Latest news about Apple stock")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### YouTube Search Tool

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain_community.tools import YouTubeSearchTool

tool_youtube = YouTubeSearchTool()

# COMMAND ----------

# Test the YouTube search tool 
tool_youtube.run("Apple company stock")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Define Toolset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, add all tools together to be used in the next step.

# COMMAND ----------

tools = [tool_wiki, tool_youtube, tool_news]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 3: Define Agent Logic
# MAGIC
# MAGIC An agent requires a planning prompt that defines how it should **reason and act**. LangChain provides a few ready-to-use prompt templates through its **[LangChain Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub)**, including those that follow the **ReAct (Reason + Act)** style.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this task, you'll pull a pre-defined ReAct-style prompt from LangChain Hub, which is designed to work with tool-using agents.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > 💡 Using the Hub simplifies your code and ensures you're working with prompt templates that are community-tested and regularly maintained.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 📚 [Learn more: LangChain Agent Executor Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/agent_executor/#create-the-agent)

# COMMAND ----------

# Import LangChain Hub
from langchain import hub

# Pull a ReAct-style prompt for function/tool-calling agents
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")

# Display the prompt structure
prompt.messages

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 4: Create the Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The final step is to create the agent using the LLM, planning prompt and toolset.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm_llama, tools, prompt)
agent_exec  = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Task 5: Run the Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's test the agent!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note: YouTube search might not return the best results. For better results, you could use a paid API/Service that supports better search.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Use this prompt:**
# MAGIC <blockquote>
# MAGIC What do you think about investing in Apple stock? Provide an overview of the latest news about the company. Next, search a video on YouTube which reviews Apple's latest financials.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Format the final answer as HTML.
# MAGIC </blockquote>
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

response = agent_exec.invoke({"input": 
    """
    What do you think about investing in Apple stock? Provide an overview of the latest news about the company. Next, search a video on YouTube which reviews Apple's latest financials.

    Format the final answer as HTML.
    """})

displayHTML(response["output"])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC It seems like the agent uses company name only when searching for videos. **Let's play with the prompt to get better results.**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In real-world, the agent would be used in a conversational way and we would just chat with the agent to tweak the search query or to adjust the response in a desired format. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Use this prompt:**
# MAGIC <blockquote>
# MAGIC What do you think about investing in Apple stock? Provide an overview of the latest news about the company. Next, search a video on YouTube which reviews Apple's latest financials.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When searching on YouTube use such as "Apple  stock finance investment earnings valuation".
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Write a nice summary of the results.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Format the final answer as HTML.
# MAGIC </blockquote>

# COMMAND ----------
